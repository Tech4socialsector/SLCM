"""
Second half of the Type of Issue migration - see
stash_type_of_issue_assignment_rules (pre_model_sync) for context.

Runs post_model_sync, once "HD Ticket Type Of Issue" exists as a real
doctype. Seeds it from the same option list the old client-side
ISSUE_OPTIONS JS map used to hardcode, carrying over any team override
found in the pre-sync stash of the now-removed assignment-rule child
table. It then rewrites existing HD Ticket rows so their
custom_type_of_issue value (previously a bare string like "Plumbing")
points at the new composite Link name ("Facilities-Plumbing") instead.
